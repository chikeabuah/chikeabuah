    %ins Catalog Description
%p
  Computing II focuses on the implementation and applications of data structures, including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, binary trees, binary search trees, heaps, graphs, and hash tables. Recursive approaches are used. Performance analysis is discussed. Attention is paid to programming style, documentation, and testing. This course includes extensive laboratory work. Effective Fall 2013, Co-req: Computing II Lab.

  %span{:style => "color: blue;"} Lectures
%p
  You are responsible for all materials presented in lecture.

  %span{:style => "color: blue;"} Collaboration
%ul
  %li
    There are no group assignments in this course. The programs are expected to be your own. You may discuss assignments and general approaches to solve a problem with the instructor, Teaching assistants, or your classmates. However, you must design and write your code by yourself. You could ask the instructor or teaching assistants for help in debugging your code.
  %li
    You cannot post any solutions for the assignments online.
  %li
    Any piece of code that was obtained through other means, e.g., interent or books, must be clearly cited.
  %li
    Any attempts to use other classmatesâ€™ code or failing to properly cite any obtained code will be considered as PLAGIARISM. Check the university
